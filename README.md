# 🔍 Binary Search Algorithm Visualizer 🎯

Welcome to the **Binary Search Algorithm Visualizer**! This project brings the power of **binary search** to life through an interactive and visually appealing experience. 💻✨

## 🌟 Features
- **Interactive UI**: Step through the binary search process with clear, colorful visualizations. 🎨
- **Customizable Arrays**: Input your own array or generate random arrays to experiment. 🎲
- **Step Control**: Move forward and backward through the algorithm, or reset at any time! ⏪⏩
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch the mid-value change and see which part of the array is being searched! 👀
- **Educational Value**: Designed to help users understand the core mechanics of binary search in a fun, engaging way. 📚

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Enter an array** or click `Generate Random Array`.
2. **Set the target value** you want to search for.
3. **Start Search**: Watch as the algorithm zeroes in on the value, with each step visualized in real-time.
4. **Step Forward/Backward**: Control the pace of the algorithm, understand each move in detail.
5. **Reset**: Start a fresh search anytime you like.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure for a clean and semantic layout.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles to create engaging and accessible visualizations.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for binary search algorithm and DOM manipulation to ensure interactive functionality.
